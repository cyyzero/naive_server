Welcome to the New York City Lost and Found Office.People often lose things when they're travelling or when they're in a hurry.They leave things on planes, on trains, on buses and in taxis.That's why there are lost and found offices at airports and stations.
The New York City Lost and Found Office is very big.Hundreds of people come here every day.They are looking for their phones, cameras, watches, computers and many other things.We usually have about two thousand mobile phones and one thousand cameras.
At the moment, there are also some strange things at the New York City Lost and Found Office.There are about a hundred bikes and a large boat.There are also a lot of animals.This week, there are three dogs, two ducks and a pig!Whose are they?Are they yours?We don't know!Are you looking for fifteen kilos of sausages?They're here too!

Welcome to the New York City Lost and Found Office.People often lose things when they're travelling or when they're in a hurry.They leave things on planes, on trains, on buses and in taxis.That's why there are lost and found offices at airports and stations.
The New York City Lost and Found Office is very big.Hundreds of people come here every day.They are looking for their phones, cameras, watches, computers and many other things.We usually have about two thousand mobile phones and one thousand cameras.
At the moment, there are also some strange things at the New York City Lost and Found Office.There are about a hundred bikes and a large boat.There are also a lot of animals.This week, there are three dogs, two ducks and a pig!Whose are they?Are they yours?We don't know!Are you looking for fifteen kilos of sausages?They're here too!
